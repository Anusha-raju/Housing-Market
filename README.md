<h1>Factors Influencing Home Prices</h1>

Home Prices depend on large number of factors such as the economy(overall GDP), interest rates, demographic trends and many others.



Here **S&P Case-Shiller index** is considered as determining factor: The Standard & Poor's  CoreLogic Caseâ€“Shiller Home Price Indices are repeat-sales house price indices for the United States. The indices are calculated monthly, using a three-month moving average algorithm. Home sales pairs are accumulated in rolling three-month periods, on which the repeat sales methodology is applied. The index point for each reporting month is based on sales pairs found for that month and the preceding two months.



Classifying these factors into supply-demand categories:

Key Factors are:

## DEMAND Factors:

1. Affordability of Housing: Rising incomes mean people are able to afford to spend more on housing. During periods of economic growth ,demand for houses tends to rise.
2. Interest Rates: Interest Rates play a big factor in determining the cost of mortgage interest repayments.
3. Mortgage availability: Another factor that determines the effective demand for houses is the willingness of banks to lend mortgages. If banks give mortgages with bigger income multiples, then the effective demand for houses is greater.
4. Economic Growth and real incomes: Rising incomes enable people to afford bigger mortgages and encourages demand for housing

### SUPPLY Factors:

1. Housing Monthly supply: This statistic provides an indication of the size of the sale-inventory in relation to the number of houses currently being sold.

2. New home supply: the number of new homes that are built and are ready to sale, this internally depends on permit availability, land availability, labour/equipment availability , Building investments availability, etc..,
3. Foreclosures index: Number of mortgaged houses that are taken to possession, when the mortgage payments are over long dues.
4. Existing home supply : The number of existing homes  that are kept out for sale.
